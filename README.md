## Introduction

Hello there, my name is Rudigus. I mean, Rodrigo Matos, but call me Rudigus.

I am a little boya who likes programming. Well, I don't think that description is very useful, considering we're on GitHub, but it's true.

I like playing games too, specially multiplayer games. It's a cool way to have fun and meet all types of people around the world. Some multiplayer games (games that have multiplayer) I've played:

* Maplestory
* Grand Chase
* Club Penguin
* Transformice
* Age Hotel (Private Habbo Hotel)
* AQW
* DDTank
* Gunbound
* Minecraft
* Agar.io

I have a wish to develop fun multiplayer games like, or at least close to, these. And I really wanna make a MMORPG game too, although it's a herculean task and the genre is basically dying (some people would say dead).

To be honest, I pretty much like everything. History and Philosophy rock. I love the internet and its underlying culture. I look forward to seeing people's point of view on different matters and seeing people argue about things on platforms like Youtube and Reddit.

## College

I'm majoring in Computer Engineering at IFCE, and I don't regret it. It's true you don't learn all the new things in college, but it improves your logical thinking, and, most importantly, you meet new people with different ideas. I could just be self-taught, but I wouldn't learn as much about things like life, thought process and similar.

## Conclusion

I'm not in the mood to write this right now, so I'll just say bye. Bye!
